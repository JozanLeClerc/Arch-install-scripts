Work in progress.

Disclaimer: While there is a basic error management, do not try to break the script as it will most certainly work. This is meant to ease your life, it is not a skill test.

Disclaimer: do NOT run this on your installed machine unless you are in the live Arch ISO environment and your intention is to install Arch on the system.

Disclaimer: this is not meant for new users. It is meant for users that already know all of this and more or less understand what's going on. It's always best to learn Arch by yourself.

Does not install too many bloatware other than some utils.

Not made for single disk dual boot, neither for multiple-disk partitionning.
