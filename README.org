#+TITLE: Joe's Arch Linux installer utility
** Introduction
My original script meant to automate your Arch Linux installation process using a FreeBSD-inspired installer interface. It is compatible with *BIOS Legacy* as well as *UEFI* boot modes.

/Note:/ while the script simplifies the whole installation process, this is not made for new users. It is meant for users that already performed Arch Linux installations and more or less understand what's going on. It's always best to learn Arch by yourself!

/Note:/ the script does not install too many bloatware other than some utils. You will be prompted to choose whether or not you want ~Xorg~ and other classic desktop user experience extras.

** How to use
*** Getting in the live Arch Linux environment
First, go to [[https://www.archlinux.org/download/][the Arch Linux download page]] and download the latest version of the Arch ISO.

Write it to a USB media. To do so, you can use some of those tools:

**** Windows
- ~rufus~

**** Linux
- ~kindd~
- ~unetbootin~
- ~dd~ (expert mode)

Plug in the USB and boot from it. You may have to change the boot order of your computer.

*** Getting and running the installer
Make sure you are booted in a live /Arch ISO environment/, with the familiar prompt waiting for instructions.

Now, you will require a working internet connection. To *try your connection* use:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
ping -c4 archlinux.org
#+END_SRC

If this fails, refer to [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Connect_to_the_internet][the Arch Wiki installation guide]] to get an internet connection working.

Now you are ready to run the script. Run *the following commands* to begin setup and installation:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
curl -o arch-installer.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JozanLeClerc/arch-installer/master/arch-installer.sh
chmod +x arch-installer.sh
./arch-installer.sh
#+END_SRC

** Partition schemes
Here are the partition schemes made by the installer:

*** UEFI mode
In UEFI boot mode, a *GPT* partition table is being created is this way:

| partition | mountpoint | filesystem | size         |
|-----------+------------+------------+--------------|
| /dev/sdx1 | /boot/efi  | FAT 32     | 128 MB       |
| /dev/sdx2 | -          | swap       | user defined |
| /dev/sdx3 | /          | ext4       | user defined |
| /dev/sdx4 | /home      | ext4       | what remains |

*** BIOS Legacy mode
In UEFI boot mode, a *DOS* partition table is being created is this way:

| partition | mountpoint | filesystem | size         |
|-----------+------------+------------+--------------|
| /dev/sdx1 | /boot      | ext2       | 128 MB       |
| /dev/sdx2 | -          | swap       | user defined |
| /dev/sdx3 | /          | ext4       | user defined |
| /dev/sdx4 | /home      | ext4       | what remains |

** Some screenshots
Here are a handful of images of the installer in action:

** Disclaimers
While there is some basic error managements, *do not* try to break the script by inputting deliberately harmful stuff when prompted. As an *Arch Linux* installation can be complex and sensitive, it will most certainly work. This is meant to ease your life, it is not a skill test.

*Do NOT* run this on your already installed machine. It will *wipe* your current installation. It is meant to be used only in the live /Arch ISO environment/ and your intention must be to install *Arch Linux* on the system.

The script does not handle *dual boot* on a *single disk*, while you should be fine with an already installed OS on another disk thanks to ~os-prober~.  
It does not handle *multiple disk partitionning*.
